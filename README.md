One week prototype challange using body tracking, hand tracking, passthrough, sceneunderstanding, and meta's voice SDK.

 The goal was to use passthrough for safety and hand tacking to move the player through a mixed reality world built with Meta's presence platform for the Oculus Quest 2. I also wanted to experiment with Meta's voice SDK so in order to navigate the course properly the player has to say the direction that the course is headed in order to remove obstacles. To make things extra challanging mines are spawned randomly through out the course and the player has to move their head to avoid them.  In order to emerse the player an not have it appear as thought the handles of the elliptical machine were passing through them. I used Meta's body tracking to overlay a body roughly there the players arms are.
